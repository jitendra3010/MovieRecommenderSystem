Movie Recommender system with Regression and Classification
The emergence of the motion picture camera in the late 18th century heralded the dawn of an unparalleled form of entertainment: cinema. From its inception with fleeting glimpses of galloping horses in the 1890s to the introduction of sound in the roaring 1920s and the advent of vibrant color in the dazzling 1930s, cinema has continually enchanted audiences worldwide.
 
While its early days may have been characterized by simplicity in plot, direction, and acting, cinema has since blossomed into a realm blessed with creative luminaries across various disciplines. Directors, screenwriters, actors, sound designers, and cinematographers have collectively woven a rich tapestry of storytelling, enriching the cinematic experience with their boundless imagination and talent.
 
Moreover, cinema has transcended boundaries, exploring a kaleidoscope of genres ranging from timeless romance to uproarious comedy, from thrilling science fiction to heart-pounding horror. Each genre offers a unique lens through which audiences can explore the depths of human emotion and experience the wonders of the imagination.
 
As technology continues to advance, cinema stands poised on the precipice of innovation, ready to embark on new frontiers of storytelling and visual spectacle. Yet, amidst the ever-changing landscape, cinema remains a beacon of creativity and inspiration, captivating hearts and minds with its unparalleled magic and allure.
Introduction
The goal of this project is to construct a machine learning model using the movie dataset. The primary objective of this project is to apply Regression classification techniques and build a story line for movie recommendations.
 
The regression algorithm will focus on predicting the revenue for a movie, the classification algorithm will focus on determining whether a movie can be classified as a success, or a failure based on various metrics available in the dataset.
 
This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to create a movie recommendation system that enhances user experience and provides valuable insights into movie success factors. By applying classification algorithms and recommender system methodologies, we anticipate building an effective solution that can benefit both movie enthusiasts and industry professionals.
For the recommender system, we plan to implement below main approaches:
1. Simple Recommender: This method will utilize top vote counts to generate a movie chart when provided with a specific genre.
2. Content-Based Recommender System: We will leverage movie metadata, including taglines, cast, crew, genre, and keywords, to build a recommendation engine that suggests movies based on content similarity.
3. Additionally, we intend to explore collaborative filtering techniques such as Single Value Decomposition (SVD) to recommend top movies based on prior ratings of a given user for a movie.
4. Hybrid Recommender System: To give personalized and accurate suggestion of movies to a user.
Through experimentation and analysis, we aim to develop robust models that enhance movie recommendations, catering to diverse user preferences. We propose to develop a comprehensive movie recommendation system that utilizes both content-based and collaborative filtering techniques. Leveraging movie metadata such as taglines, cast, crew, genre, and keywords, the system will provide personalized movie recommendations to users based on content similarity. Additionally, collaborative filtering methods, including Single Value Decomposition (SVD), will be explored to recommend top movies based on user ratings.
